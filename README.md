============

Change Point Algorithm from Randy Gallistel rewritten in R for evaluating individual learning curves in behavioral experiments.

Download all the files and run the Compiler.R function to define the functions in the workspace.

This is the branch where code optimation needs to occur since this code has some pretty bad redundancies since I did not know what I was doing converting it from MATLAB to R.
